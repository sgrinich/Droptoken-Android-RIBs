# Droptoken-Android-RIBs

I developed this application using Uber's cross-platform mobile architecture framework, [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs). 

It should be noted that I scaffolded this application using one of the tutorials in the above link. This is why you may see directories containing the word 'tutorial.'
