# Droptoken-Android-RIBs

Drop tokens against the machine in a race to connect four.

I developed this Android app as an exericise in learning [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs), Uber's cross-platform mobile architecture framework. 

It should be noted that I scaffolded this application using one of the tutorials in the above link. Given the time constraint I decided to leave these directories as they were named. The bulk of the source for this project will found within tutorials/tutorial3-complete.
