# Droptoken-Android-RIBs

Drop tokens against the machine in a race to connect four.

I developed this application using Uber's cross-platform mobile architecture framework, [RIBs](https://github.com/uber/RIBs). 

It should be noted that I scaffolded this application using one of the tutorials in the above link. Given the time constraint I left these directories as they were named. The bulk of the source for this project will found within tutorial/tutorial3-complete.
